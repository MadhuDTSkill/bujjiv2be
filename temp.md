In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of "the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema". In 2024, he was honoured with a Guinness World Record as the most prolific actor-dancer in the Indian film industry.[8]

Chiranjeevi made his acting debut in 1978, initially gaining recognition for his supporting, anti-hero, and antagonist roles. He later transitioned to lead roles with notable success. His breakthrough came with the 1983 film Khaidi, which became the highest-grossing Telugu film at the time and established him as a leading actor in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Chiranjeevi starred in various "Industry Hits"—highest-grossers of all time—like Pasivadi Pranam (1987), Yamudiki Mogudu (1988), Attaku Yamudu Ammayiki Mogudu (1989), Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari (1990), Gang Leader (1991), and Gharana Mogudu (1992).[6] Notably, Gharana Mogudu was the first South Indian film to earn over ₹10 crore in distributor share,[9] prompting The Week magazine to label him "Bigger than Bachchan" and "the new money machine."[10]

For his role in Aapadbandhavudu (1992), Chiranjeevi was paid ₹1.25 crore, making him the highest-paid actor in India at the time and the first Indian actor to command a ₹1 crore remuneration for a film.[11] During this period, he received widespread critical acclaim for his performances in Swayamkrushi (1987), Rudraveena (1988), and Aapadbandhavudu (1992), showcasing his versatility as an actor who excelled in both commercial blockbusters and critically acclaimed films. Notably, Swayamkrushi was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival, while Rudraveena, which he co-produced, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Chiranjeevi continued to dominate the box office with films like Master (1997), and Choodalani Vundi (1998). His 2002 film Indra was the highest-grossing Telugu film for many years, and socially impactful films like Tagore (2003) and Shankar Dada M.B.B.S. (2004) became major blockbusters, further cementing his legacy.

On 2 October 1998, Chiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust, which operates the largest blood and eye banks in the Telugu states. The trust has restored eyesight to over 9,000 individuals through cornea transplants and provides 70% of collected blood free to the poor.[12] It has received several accolades, including the "Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award" from the Government of Andhra Pradesh for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006.[13] In 2002, he was honoured with the Samman Award by the Income Tax Department, for being the highest income tax payer in the profession category for the assessment year 1999–2000.[14]

In 2008, Chiranjeevi founded the Praja Rajyam Party and led it in the 2009 Andhra Pradesh elections, where it won 18 seats and secured over 16% of the vote, making it the third-largest party in the state. The party merged with the Indian National Congress in 2011. Chiranjeevi served as a Rajya Sabha MP from 2012 to 2018 and was appointed Minister of Tourism in the central cabinet of India in October 2012, holding the position until May 2014. After a hiatus from cinema, he returned with the blockbuster hit Khaidi No. 150 (2017), followed by successful films such as Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019) and Waltair Veerayya (2023).

Chiranjeevi is the uncle to actors Allu Arjun, Varun Tej, Niharika, Sai Dharam Tej, and Panja Vaisshnav Tej.[22]

Acting career
1978–1981: Early career
Since his family worshipped Anjaneya (Hanuman), a Hindu deity, his mother advised him to take the screen name "Chiranjeevi", meaning "Immortal", a reference to the belief of Hanuman living forever.[23]

Chiranjeevi started his film career with Punadhirallu (1979).[24] However, his first released film was Pranam Khareedu (1978).[25][26] Mana Voori Pandavulu (1978), directed by Bapu, gave Chiranjeevi recognition from the Telugu audience.[18] He played a small role in Tayaramma Bangarayya (1979). He played the anti-hero in films I Love You (1979) and K. Balachander's Idi Katha Kaadu (1979),[18] starring Kamal Haasan.

In a remake of the Tamil film Avargal (1977), Chiranjeevi portrayed the character played by Rajinikanth in the original. In 1979, Chiranjeevi had eight major film releases and then 14 films in the following year.[27][28] In 1981, he played lead antagonist in works such as Mosagadu, Rani Kasula Rangamma, 47 Natkal /47 Rojulu, Nyayam Kavali and Ranuva Veeran.[29]

1982–1986: Breakthrough with leading roles
Chiranjeevi began to appear in leading roles with films such as Intlo Ramayya Veedhilo Krishnayya (1982), directed by Kodi Ramakrishna, which was a hit at the box office.[30] Later, he starred in Subhalekha (1982), directed by K. Viswanath, which dealt with the social malady of the dowry system. It brought him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and Viswanath's third Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu.[31][32] In 1982, he also appeared in movies such as Idi Pellantara, Sitadevi, Tingu Rangadu, Bandhalu Anubandhalu and Mondi Ghatam. He acted in multi-star movies such as Patnam Vachina Pativrathalu and Billa Ranga, and later appeared in Manchu Pallaki.[33]

He co-produced and acted in Rudraveena (1988), which won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration,[38] and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[38][39] The title "Megastar" appeared for the first time in the title cards of the 1988 release Marana Mrudangam, marking its association with Chiranjeevi.[38] During the shoot of Marana Mrudangam, Chiranjeevi was poisoned by a fan who attempted to get closer to him.[40] The incident was recalled by Chiranjeevi in 2023, who took it lightly as an act of misguided admiration.[41]

He then experimented with Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari (1990), a fantasy film directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and produced by Aswini Dutt. Other notable works during this period include Kondaveeti Donga (1990), released in 70 mm format with 6-Track stereophonic sound, the cowboy film Kodama Simham (1990), and the social problem action film Gang Leader (1991). These films were major box-office successes and established Chiranjeevi as the "Boss of Telugu cinema".[42] The 1992 film Gharana Mogudu was the first South Indian and Telugu film to collect over ₹10 crore in distributor share at the box office.[9][43][14] The film was screened at the 1993 International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section.[44]

Chiranjeevi's Bollywood performances were appreciated in Pratibandh[45] and Aaj Ka Goonda Raaj. For his role in Aapadbandhavudu (1992), he received his second Nandi Award for Best Actor and third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The mid-1990s saw a career dip for Chiranjeevi with box office duds such as S. P. Parasuram, The Gentleman, Big Boss and Rikshavodu. There were exceptions, such as Muta Mestri, which fetched him a fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; Mugguru Monagallu and Alluda Majaka were also successful.[36] In 1996, he appeared in a guest role in the Kannada film Sipayi. After a brief lull, Chiranjeevi bounced back with Hitler, Master, Bavagaru Bagunnara?, Choodalani Vundi and Sneham Kosam, for which he received his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. In 1999, Chiranjeevi was to appear in a Hollywood production directed by Dushan Garsi, and produced by Rameshkrishna Murthi. The Telugu version was directed by Suresh Krissna. The movie, which was titled The Return of the Thief of Baghdad, had its filming suspended for undisclosed reasons.[46]

Chiranjeevi's new decade started with Annayya (2000). After a brief gap, Chiranjeevi starred in Indra, released in 2002, which broke all his previous box office records of Tollywood and won him his third Nandi Award for Best Actor and sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. After that, he appeared in films with an underlying message and a social cause, including Tagore; Shankar Dada M.B.B.S., for which he won his seventh and latest Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; and Stalin. He was awarded the Filmfare Special Award – South in 2006 and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in 2011 for his contributions to the film industry.[47]
